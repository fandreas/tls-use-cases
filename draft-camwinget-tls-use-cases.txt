Abstract

   TLS 1.3 introduces several changes to TLS 1.2 in order to improve the
   overall security and privacy provided by TLS.  However some of these
   changes have a negative impact on network-based security solutions.
   While this may be viewed a feature, there are several real-life use
   case scenarios that are not easily solved without such network-based
   security solutions.  In this document, we identify the TLS 1.3
   changes that may negatively impact network-based security solutions
   and provide a set of use case scenarios that are not easily solved
   without such solutions.

Internet-Draft  TLS 1.3 Impact on Network-Based Security    October 2017


1.  Introduction

   Network-based security solutions such as Firewalls (FW) and Intrusion
   Prevention Systems (IPS) rely on network traffic inspection to
   implement perimeter-based security policies.  Depending on the
   security functions required, these middleboxes can either be deployed
   as traffic monitoring devices or active in-line devices.  A traffic
   monitoring middlebox may for example perform vulnerability detection,
   intrusion detection, crypto audit, compliance monitoring, etc.  An
   active in-line middlebox may for example prevent malware download,
   block known malicous URLs, enforce use of strong ciphers, stop data
   exfiltration, etc.  A significant portion of such security policies
   require clear-text traffic inspection above Layer 4, which becomes
   problematic when traffic is encrypted with Transport Layer Security
   (TLS) [RFC5246].  Today, network-based security solutions typically
   address this problem by becoming a man-in-the-middle (MITM) for the
   TLS session according to one of the following two scenarios:

   1.  Outbound Session, where the TLS session originates from inside
       the perimeter towards an entity on the outside

   2.  Inbound Session, where the TLS session originates from outside
       the perimeter towards an entity on the inside

   For the outbound session scenario, a local root certificate and an
   accompanying (local) public/private key pair is generated.  The local
   root certificate is installed on the inside entities for which TLS
   traffic is to be inspected, and the network security device(s) store
   a copy of the private key.  During the TLS handshake, the network
   security device (hereafter referred to as a TLS proxy) modifies the
   certificate provided by the (outside) server and (re)signs it with
   the private key from the local root certificate.  From here on, the
   TLS proxy has visibility into further exchanges between the client
   and server which enables it to to decrypt and inspect subsequent
   network traffic.

   For the Inbound session scenario, the TLS proxy is configured with a
   copy of the local servers' certificate(s) and corresponding private
   key(s).  Based on the server certificate presented, the TLS proxy
   determines the corresponding private key, which again enables the TLS
   proxy to gain visibility into further exchanges between the client
   and server and hence decrypt subsequent network traffic.

   To date, there are a number of use case scenarios that rely on the
   above capabilities when used with TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] or earlier.  TLS
   1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13] introduces several changes which prevent a
   number of these use case scenarios from being satisfied with the
   types of TLS proxy based capabilities that exist today.

Internet-Draft  TLS 1.3 Impact on Network-Based Security    October 2017


   Currently deployed TLS proxies (middleboxes) may reduce the security
   of the TLS connection itself due to a combination of poor
   implementation and configuration [HTTPSintercept], and they may
   compromise privacy when decrypting a TLS session.  As such, it has
   been argued that preventing TLS proxies from working should be viewed
   as a feature of TLS 1.3 and that the proper way of solving these
   issues is to rely on endpoint (client and server) based solutions
   instead.  We believe this is an overly constrained view of the
   problem that ignores a number of important real-life use case
   scenarios that improve the overall security posture.  We also note
   that current endpoint-based TLS proxies suffer from many of the same
   security issues as the network-based TLS proxies (middleboxes)
   [HTTPSintercept].

   The purpose of this document is to provide a representative set of
   _network based security_ use case scenarios that are negatively
   impacted by TLS 1.3 and do not lend themselves to an endpoint-based
   alternative solution.  For each use case scenario, we highlight the
   specific aspect(s) of TLS 1.3 that makes the use case problematic
   with a TLS proxy based solution and we explain why an endpoint-based
   only solution is not considered acceptable.

   It should be noted that this document is looking only at _security_
   use cases with a focus on identifying the problematic ones.  The
   document does not offer specific solutions to these; the goal is to
   stimulate further discussion and explore possible solutions
   subsequently.

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119, BCP 14 [RFC2119].

2.  TLS 1.3 Change Impact Overview

   TlS 1.3 introduces several changes to TLS 1.2 in order to improve the
   overall privacy and security of TLS, however in doing so, some of the
   changes have a negative impact on network based security.  In this
   section, we describe the TLS 1.3 changes that negatively impact
   network based security solutions.  We divide the changes into two
   groups; those that impact inbound sessions and those that impact
   outbound sessions.

Internet-Draft  TLS 1.3 Impact on Network-Based Security    October 2017


2.1.  Inbound Session Change Impacts

2.1.1.  Removal of Static RSA and Diffie-Hellman Cipher Suites

   TLS 1.2 supports static RSA and Diffie-Hellman cipher suites, which
   enables the server's private key to be shared with server-side
   middle-boxes.  TLS 1.3 has removed support for these cipher suites in
   favor of ephemeral mode Diffie-Hellman in order to provide perfect
   forward secrecy (PFS).  As a result of this, it is no longer possible
   for a server to share a key with the middlebox a priori, which in
   turn implies that the middlebox cannot gain access to the TLS session
   data.

   Example scenarios that are impacted by this include network
   monitoring, troubleshooting, compliance, etc.

   For further details (and a suggestion solution), please refer to
   [I-D.green-tls-static-dh-in-tls13].

2.2.  Outbound Session Change Impacts

2.2.1.  Encrypted Server Certificate

   In TLS 1.2, the ClientHello message is sent to the server's transport
   address (IP and port).  The ClientHello message may include the
   Server Name Indication (SNI) to specify the actual server the client
   wishes to contact.  This is useful when multiple "virtual servers"
   are hosted on a given transport address (IP and port).  It also
   provides information about the domain the client is attempting to
   reach.

   The server replies with a ServerHello message, which contains the
   selected connection parameters, followed by a Certificate message,
   which contains the server's certificate and hence its identity.

   In TLS 1.2, the ClientHello, ServerHello and Certificate messages are
   all sent in clear-text, however in TLS 1.3, the Certificate message
   is encrypted thereby hiding the server identity from any
   intermediary.  Note that even _if_ the SNI is provided (in cleartext)
   by the client, there is no guarantee that the actual server
   responding is the one indicated in the SNI from the client.

   Example scenarios that are impacted by this involve selective network
   security, such as whitelists or blacklists based on security
   intelligence, regulatory requirements, categories (e.g. finanicial
   services), etc.  An added challenge is that some of these scenarios
   require the middlebox to perform inspection, whereas other scenarios
   require the middlebox to not perform inspection.

Internet-Draft  TLS 1.3 Impact on Network-Based Security    October 2017


2.2.2.  Resumption and Pre-Shared Key

   In TLS 1.2 and below, session resumption is provided by "session IDs"
   and "session tickets" [RFC5077].  If the server does not want to
   honor a ticket, then it can simply initiate a full TLS handshake with
   the client as usual.

   In TLS 1.3, the above mechanism is replaced by Pre-Shared Keys (PSK),
   which can be negotiated as part of an initial handshake and then used
   in a subsequent handshake to perform resumption using the PSK.  TLS
   1.3 states that the client SHOULD include a "key_share" extension to
   enable the server to decline resumption and fall back to a full
   handshake, however it is not an absolute requirement.

   Example scenarios that are impacted by this are middleboxes that were
   not part of the initial handshake, and hence do not know the PSK.  If
   the client does not include the "key_share" extension the middlebox
   cannot force a fallback to the full handshake.  If the middlebox is
   required to inspect the session, it will have to fail the connection
   instead.

2.2.3.  Version Downgrade Protection

   In TLS, the ClientHello message includes a list of supported protocol
   versions.  The server will select the highest supported version and
   indicate its choice in the ServerHello message.

   In TLS 1.3, the random value in the ServerHello message includes a
   special value in the last eight bytes when the server negotiates
   either TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.1 and below.  The special value(s) enable a
   TLS 1.3 client to detect an active attacker launching a downgrade
   attack when the client did indeed reach a TLS 1.3 server, provided
   ephemeral ciphers are being used.

   From a network security point of view, the primary impact of this
   change is that it requires the middlebox to be an active man-in-the-
   middle.  This is not different from current behavior of middleboxes,
   as long as the middlebox effectively proxies between a client-to-
   middlebox and a middlebox-to-server TLS connection.

2.2.4.  1-RTT Handshake

2.2.5.  0-RTT Data

Internet-Draft  TLS 1.3 Impact on Network-Based Security    October 2017


2.2.6.  SNI Encryption in TLS Through Tunneling

   As noted above, with server certificates encrypted, the Server Name
   Indication (SNI) in the ClientHello message is the only information
   available in cleartext to indicate the client's targeted server, and
   the actual server reached may differ.

   [I-D.ietf-tls-sni-encryption] proposes to hide the SNI in the
   ClientHello from middleboxes.

   Example scenarios that are impacted by this involve selective network
   security, such as whitelists or blacklists based on security
   intelligence, regulatory requirements, categories (e.g. financial
   services), etc.  An added challenge is that some of these scenarios
   require the middlebox to perform inspection, whereas other scenarios
   require the middlebox to not perform inspection, however without the
   SNI, the middlebox may not have the information required to determine
   the actual scenario before it is too late.

3.  Inbound Session Use Cases

3.1.  Use Case I1 - Data Center Protection

3.2.  Use Case I2 - Application Operation over NAT

3.3.  Use Case I3 - Compliance

3.4.  Use Case I4 - Crypto Security Audit

   Organizations may have policies around acceptable ciphers and
   certificates on their servers.  Examples include no use of self-
   signed certificates, black or white-list Certificate Authority, etc.
   In TLS 1.2, the Certificate message was sent in clear-text, however
   in TLS 1.3 the message is encrypted thereby preventing either a
   network-based audit or policy enforcement around acceptable server
   certificates.

   While the audits and policy enforcements could in theory be done on
   the servers themselves, the premise of the use case is that not all
   servers are configured correctly and hence such an approach is
   unlikely to work in practice.  A common example where this occurs
   includes lab servers.

Internet-Draft  TLS 1.3 Impact on Network-Based Security    October 2017


4.1.  Use Case O1 - Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)

   Enterprises deploy security devices to enforce Acceptable Use Policy
   (AUP) accroding to the IT and workplace policies.  The security
   devices, such as firewall/next-gen firewall and web proxy, act as
   middle boxes to scan traffic in the enterprise network for policy
   enforcement.

   Sample AUP policies are:

   "Employess are not allowed to access 'gaming' websites from
   enterprise network"

   "Temporary workers are not allowed to use enterprise network to
   upload video clips to Internet, but are allowed to watch video clips"

   Such enforcements are accomplished by controlling the DNS
   transactions and HTTP transactions.  A coase control is achieved by
   controlling the DNS response, however, in many cases, granular
   control is required at HTTP URL or Method levels, to distinguish a
   specific web page on a hosting site, or to differentiate between
   uploading and downloading operations.

   The security device requires to access plain text HTTP header for
   granular AUP control.

4.2.  Use Case O2 - Malware and Threat Protection

   Enterprises adopt a multi-technology approach when it comes to
   malware and threat protection for the network assets.  This include
   solutions deployed on the endpoint, network and cloud.

   While endpoint application based solution is effective in protecting
   from malware and virus attecks, enterprises prefer to deploy multiple
   technologies for a multi-layer protection.  Network based solutions
   provide such additional protection with benefits including lower
   manangement costs.

   The network based solutions comprise security devices and
   applications that scan network traffic for the purpose from malware
   signatures to 0-day analysis.  The security functions require access
   to clear text HTTP or other application level streams.

4.3.  Use Case O3 - IoT Endpoints

   As the Internet of Everything continues to evolve, more and more
   endpoints become connected to the Internet.  From a security point of
   view, some of the challenges presented by these are:

Internet-Draft  TLS 1.3 Impact on Network-Based Security    October 2017


   o  Constrained devices with limited resources (CPU, memory, etc.)

   o  Lack of ability to install and update endpoint protection
      software.

   o  Lack of software updates as new vulnerabilities are discovered.

4.4.  Use Case O4 - Unpatched Endpoints

   New vulnerabilities appear constantly and in spite of many advances
   in recent years in terms of automated software updates, especially in
   reaction to security vulnerabilities, the fact of the matter is that
   a very large number of endpoints continue to run versions of software
   with known vulnerabilities.

   In theory, these endpoints should of course be patched, but in
   practice, it is often not done which leaves the endpoint open to the
   vulnerability in question.  A network-based security solution can
   look for attempted exploits of such vulnerabilities and stop them
   before they reach the unpatched endpoint.

4.5.  Use Case O5 - Rapid Containment of New Vulnerability and Campaigns

   When a new vulnerability is discovered or an attack campaign is
   launched, it is important to patch the vulnerability or contain the
   campaign as quickly as possible.  Patches however are not always
   available immediately, and even when they are, most endpoints are in
   practice not patched immediately, which leaves them open to the
   attack.

   A network-based security solution can look for attempted exploits of
   such new vulnerabilities or recognize an attack being launched based
   on security intelligence related to the campaign and stop them before
   they reach the vulnerable endpoint.

4.6.  Use Case O6 - End-of-Life Endpoint

   Older endpoints (and in some cases even new ones) will not receive
   any software updates.  As new vulnerabilities inevitably are
   discovered, these endpoints will be vulnerable to exploits.

   A network-based security solution can help prevent such exploits.

4.7.  Use Case O7 - Compliance

Internet-Draft  TLS 1.3 Impact on Network-Based Security    October 2017


4.8.  Use Case O8 - Crypto Security Audit

   This is a variation of the use in Section 3.4

   Organizations may have policies around acceptable ciphers and
   certificates for client sessions, possibly based on the destination.
   Examples include no use of self-signed certificates, black or white-
   list Certificate Authority, etc.  In TLS 1.2, the Certificate message
   was sent in clear-text, however in TLS 1.3 the message is encrypted
   thereby preventing either a network-based audit or policy enforcement
   around acceptable server certificates.

   While the audits and policy enforcements could in theory be done on
   the clients themselves, not all clients are configured correctly and
   may not even be directly under configuration control of the
   organization in question (e.g. due to Bring Your Own Device).
