</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">Enterprises, public sector, and cloud service providers need to defend their information systems from attacks originating from both inside and outside their networks. Protection and detection are typically done both on end hosts and in the network. Host agents have deep visibility on the devices where they are installed, whereas the network has broader visibility and provides homogenous security controls across heterogenous endpoints, covering devices for which no host monitoring is available (which is common today and is increasingly so in the Internet of Things). This helps protect against unauthorized devices installed by insiders, and provides a fallback in case the infection of a host disables its security agent. Because of these advantages, network-based security mechanisms are widely used. In fact, regulatory standards such as NERC CIP <a href="#NERCCIP" class="xref">[NERCCIP]</a> place strong requirements about network perimeter security and its ability to have visibility to provide security information to the security management and control systems. At the same time, the privacy of employees, customers, and other users must be respected by minimizing the collection of personal data and controlling access to what data is collected. These imperatives hold for both end host and network based security monitoring.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">Network-based security solutions such as Firewalls (FW) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) rely on network traffic inspection to implement perimeter-based security policies. Depending on the security functions required, these middleboxes can either be deployed as traffic monitoring devices or active in-line devices. A traffic monitoring middlebox may for example perform vulnerability detection, intrusion detection, crypto audit, compliance monitoring, etc. An active in-line middlebox may for example prevent malware download, block known malicious URLs, enforce use of strong ciphers, stop data exfiltration, etc. A significant portion of such security policies require clear-text traffic inspection above Layer 4, which becomes problematic when traffic is encrypted with Transport Layer Security (TLS) <a href="#RFC5246" class="xref">[RFC5246]</a>. Today, network-based security solutions typically address this problem by becoming a man-in-the-middle (MITM) for the TLS session according to one of the following two scenarios:</p>
<p></p>

<ol>
<li>Outbound Session, where the TLS session originates from a client inside the perimeter towards an entity on the outside</li>
<li>Inbound Session, where the TLS session originates from a client outside the perimeter towards an entity on the inside</li>
</ol>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">For the outbound session scenario, MITM is enabled by generating a local root certificate and an accompanying (local) public/private key pair. The local root certificate is installed on the inside entities for which TLS traffic is to be inspected, and the network security device(s) store a copy of the private key. During the TLS handshake, the network security device (hereafter referred to as a TLS proxy) modifies the certificate provided by the (outside) server and (re)signs it with the private key from the local root certificate. From here on, the TLS proxy has visibility into further exchanges between the client and server which enables it to decrypt and inspect subsequent network traffic.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">For the inbound session scenario, the TLS proxy is configured with a copy of the local servers' certificate(s) and corresponding private key(s). Based on the server certificate presented, the TLS proxy determines the corresponding private key, which again enables the TLS proxy to gain visibility into further exchanges between the client and server and hence decrypt subsequent network traffic.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.6">To date, there are a number of use case scenarios that rely on the above capabilities when used with TLS 1.2 <a href="#RFC5246" class="xref">[RFC5246]</a> or earlier. TLS 1.3 <a href="#I-D.ietf-tls-tls13" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-tls-tls13]</a> introduces several changes which prevent a number of these use case scenarios from being satisfied with the types of TLS proxy based capabilities that exist today.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.7">It has been noted, that currently deployed TLS proxies (middleboxes) may reduce the security of the TLS connection itself due to a combination of poor implementation and configuration, and they may compromise privacy when decrypting a TLS session. As such, it has been argued that preventing TLS proxies from working should be viewed as a feature of TLS 1.3 and that the proper way of solving these issues is to rely on endpoint (client and server) based solutions instead. We believe this is an overly constrained view of the problem that ignores a number of important real-life use case scenarios that improve the overall security posture. We also note that current endpoint-based TLS proxies suffer from many of the same security issues as the network-based TLS proxies do <a href="#HTTPSintercept" class="xref">[HTTPSintercept]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.8">The purpose of this document is to provide a representative set of <em>network based security</em> use case scenarios that are negatively impacted by TLS 1.3 and do not lend themselves to an endpoint-based alternative solution. For each use case scenario, we highlight the specific aspect(s) of TLS 1.3 that makes the use case problematic with a TLS proxy based solution and we explain why an endpoint-based only solution is not considered acceptable.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.9">It should be noted that this document addresses only <em>security</em> use cases with a focus on identifying the problematic ones. The document does not offer specific solutions to these as the goal is to stimulate further discussion and explore possible solutions subsequently.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.2.1.1.p.1">TLS 1.2 supports static RSA and Diffie-Hellman cipher suites, which enables the server's private key to be shared with server-side middle-boxes. TLS 1.3 has removed support for these cipher suites in favor of ephemeral mode Diffie-Hellman in order to provide perfect forward secrecy (PFS). As a result of this, it is no longer possible for a server to share a key with the middlebox a priori, which in turn implies that the middlebox cannot gain access to the TLS session data.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.2.2.1.p.1">In TLS 1.2, the ClientHello message is sent to the server's transport address (IP and port). The ClientHello message may include the Server Name Indication (SNI) to specify the actual server the client wishes to contact. This is useful when multiple "virtual servers" are hosted on a given transport address (IP and port). It also provides information about the domain the client is attempting to reach.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.1.p.2">The server replies with a ServerHello message, which contains the selected connection parameters, followed by a Certificate message, which contains the server's certificate and hence its identity.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.1.p.3">In TLS 1.2, the ClientHello, ServerHello and Certificate messages are all sent in clear-text, however in TLS 1.3, the Certificate message is encrypted thereby hiding the server identity from any intermediary. Note that even <em>if</em> the SNI is provided (in cleartext) by the client, there is no guarantee that the actual server responding is the one indicated in the SNI from the client.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.1.p.4">Example scenarios that are impacted by this involve selective network security, such as whitelists or blacklists based on security intelligence, regulatory requirements, categories (e.g. financial services), etc. An added challenge is that some of these scenarios require the middlebox to perform inspection, whereas other scenarios require the middlebox to <em>not</em> perform inspection.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.2.2.2.p.1">In TLS 1.2 and below, session resumption is provided by "session IDs" and "session tickets" <a href="#RFC5077" class="xref">[RFC5077]</a>. If the server does not want to honor a ticket, then it can simply initiate a full TLS handshake with the client as usual.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.2.p.2">In TLS 1.3, the above mechanism is replaced by Pre-Shared Keys (PSK), which can be negotiated as part of an initial handshake and then used in a subsequent handshake to perform resumption using the PSK. TLS 1.3 states that the client SHOULD include a "key_share" extension to enable the server to decline resumption and fall back to a full handshake, however it is not an absolute requirement.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.2.p.3">Example scenarios that are impacted by this are middleboxes that were not part of the initial handshake, and hence do not know the PSK. If the client does not include the "key_share" extension, the middlebox cannot force a fallback to the full handshake. If the middlebox policy requires it to inspect the session, it will have to fail the connection instead.</p>
<h3 id="rfc.section.2.2.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.2.2.3">2.2.3.</a> <a href="#DisengageMiddlebox" id="DisengageMiddlebox">Ability to Disengage Middlebox Proxy</a>
</h3>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.3.p.1">Network security middleboxes intercept or proxy TLS sessions for acceptable use policy, protocol inspection, malware scanning and other purposes.  For compliance and privacy reasons, middleboxes must be able to engage and disengage the proxy function seamlessly without affecting user experience. For example, privacy laws may prohibit middleboxes from intercepting banking traffic even if it is within the enterprise network and outbound network traffic is subject to inspection legally.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.3.p.2">There are several techniques that can be utilized.  Those techniques function with TLS 1.2 and earlier versions but not with TLS 1.3.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.3.p.3">One technique is for the middlebox to negotiate the same master secret with the original TLS client and server, as if the two endpoints handshake directly. This is also known as "Triple Handshake" used by legitimate middleboxes. <a href="#BreakTLS" class="xref">[BreakTLS]</a> describes the methods with RSA and DH key exchanges.  When the proxy session keys are the same as for a direct handshake, the middlebox is able to "cut-through" the two TLS proxy sessions when it finishes the security inspection.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.3.p.4">This technique is not functional with TLS 1.3 since the transcript hash over the handshake messages is part of the key derivation procedure.</p>

</h3>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.4.p.1">In TLS, the ClientHello message includes a list of supported protocol versions. The server will select the highest supported version and indicate its choice in the ServerHello message.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.4.p.2">TLS 1.3 changes the way in which version negotiation is performed. The ClientHello message will indicate TLS version 1.3 in the new "supported_versions" extension, however for backwards compatibility with TLS 1.2, the ClientHellow message will indicate TLS version 1.2 in the "legacy_version" field. A TLS 1.3 server will recognize that TLS 1.3 is being negotiated, whereas a TLS 1.2 server will simply see a TLS 1.2 ClientHello and proceed with TLS 1.2 negotiation.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.4.p.3">In TLS 1.3, the random value in the ServerHello message includes a special value in the last eight bytes when the server negotiates either TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.1 and below. The special value(s) enable a TLS 1.3 client to detect an active attacker launching a downgrade attack when the client did indeed reach a TLS 1.3 server, provided ephemeral ciphers are being used.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.4.p.4">From a network security point of view, the primary impact is that TLS 1.3 requires the TLS proxy to be an active man-in-the-middle from the start of the handshake (as explained in <a href="#DisengageMiddlebox" class="xref">Section 2.2.3</a>). However, a middlebox that supports only TLS 1.2 may let the initial TLS 1.3 ClientHello proceed resulting in a TLS 1.3 ServerHello from the server, which the middlebox does not support. Depending on the policy configured, the TLS proxy may reject the session at that point.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.4.p.5">If the TLS 1.2 middlebox takes on an active role in the handshake from the start, then the middlebox effectively proxies between a client-to-middlebox and a middlebox-to-server TLS connection, in which case the handshake succeeds (but as TLS 1.2). Note that due to downgrade protection, the proxy cannot simply downgrade the TLS version to 1.2 in the ClientHellow, which would enable it to disengage from the handshake later.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.2.2.5.p.1">As noted above, with server certificates encrypted, the Server Name Indication (SNI) in the ClientHello message is the only information available in cleartext to indicate the client's targeted server, and the actual server reached may differ.</p>
<p><a href="#I-D.ietf-tls-sni-encryption" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-tls-sni-encryption]</a> proposes to hide the SNI in the ClientHello from middleboxes.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.5.p.3">Example scenarios that are impacted by this involve selective network security, such as whitelists or blacklists based on security intelligence, regulatory requirements, categories (e.g. financial services), etc. An added challenge is that some of these scenarios require the middlebox to perform inspection, whereas other scenarios require the middlebox to not perform inspection, however without the SNI, the middlebox may not have the information required to determine the actual scenario before it is too late.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.2">These network security functions are usually deployed in two modes: monitoring and inline.  In either case, they need to access the L7 and application data such as HTTP transactions which could be protected by TLS encryption.

<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.1">Many regulations exist today that include cyber security requirements requiring close inspection of the information traversing through the network.  For example, organizations that require PCI-DSS <a href="#PCI-DSS" class="xref">[PCI-DSS]</a> compliance must provide the ability to regularly monitor the network to prevent, detect and minimize impact of a data compromise.  <a href="#PCI-DSS" class="xref">[PCI-DSS]</a> Requirement #2 (and Appendix A2 as it concerns TLS) describes the need to be able to detect protocol and protocol usage correctness.

<p id="rfc.section.3.4.p.2">While the audits and policy enforcements could in theory be done on the servers themselves, the premise of the use case is that not all servers are configured correctly and hence such an approach is unlikely to work in practice.

<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.4">Such enforcements are accomplished by controlling the DNS transactions and HTTP transactions.  A coarse control is achieved by controlling the DNS response (which itself may be protected by TLS), however, in many cases, granular control is required at HTTP URL or Method levels, to distinguish a specific web page on a hosting site, or to differentiate between uploading and downloading operations.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.5">The security device requires access to plain text HTTP header for granular AUP control. For traffic passing the AUP check, the middlebox is also required to cut through the rest of the traffic without decryption, for performance and privacy reasons.</p>
